This tutorial provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to performing contrast analysis using the spaceKLIP pipeline. By the end of this notebook, you will gain practical experience with tools and techniques essential for analyzing MIRI coronagraphic data. This knowledge will equip you to apply these methods to similar datasets, enhancing your ability to extract meaningful results from high-contrast imaging observations.\n",

    "The results obtained here can be directly compared to the [JWST Early Release Science (ERS) coronagraphic observations of the super-Jupiter exoplanet HIP 65426b](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acd93e), published by Aarynn Carter et al. Specifically, we find in the tutorial an apparent magnitude (relative to Vega) of 13.794±0.1870, compared to the paper's report of 14.705±0.182. Differences can be due to various updates in the JWST pipeline (notably an update to MIRI flux calibration) and the spaceKLIP algorithm. Additionally, note that the ERS paper employs a different error analysis method. \n",
